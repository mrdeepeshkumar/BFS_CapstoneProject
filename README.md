# BFS_CapstoneProject

# Objective:
To help CredX identify the right customers using predictive models using past data of the bank’s applicants.

## Business Undestanding: 
CredX is a leading credit card provider that gets thousands of credit card applications every year. But in the past few years, it has experienced an increase in credit loss. The CEO believes that the best strategy to mitigate credit risk is to ‘acquire the right customers’.

## Understanding the Data
There are two data sets in this project: demographic and credit bureau data.  

### Demographic/application data: 
This is obtained from the information provided by the applicants at the time of credit card application. It contains customer-level information on age, gender, income, marital status, etc.
### Credit bureau: 
This is taken from the credit bureau and contains variables such as 'number of times 30 DPD or worse in last 3/6/12 months', 'outstanding balance', 'number of trades', etc.
